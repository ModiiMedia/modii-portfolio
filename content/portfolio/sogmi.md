  # Modii used the Hugo framework to build a blazing fast modern website for Sons of God Ministries International (SOGMI).

  SOGMI has a lot of listeners and viewers in the United States and in Southeast Asia meaning they needed a website that was fast not only in the US but around the world.

    ## Custom Podcast Player

    SOGMI needed a way to for their radio listeners to listen to podcasts on the website. We built out a custom audio player that looks great on all devices.
