The donor's information is stored within SOGMI's customer database in Square. Allowing them to keep track of everyone who has donated using the kiosk. \n\n<video autoplay loop><source src=\"/video/sogmi-donation-kiosk-video-v2.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.  \n</video>"
