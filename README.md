# Modiimedia.com

Portfolio website for Modii, made using [hugo](https://gohugo.io), [Bulma](https://bulma.io), and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

run `npm start` to start developing.

## Templates

Hugo's templating engine is used for layouts. These can be edited in the layouts/ directory

## Editing Styles

Styles are edited in the /styles/ directory and are then pushed to /static/css/ for Hugo's consumption when saved.

Do not edit .css files in static/css/ as the SCSS files will be exported to that directory so any changes made in static/css/ will be overritten.
